           The demand for meteorites is quite high all over the world! Many have called them the “truest form of black gold,” and they often sell for $300.00 per gram or more - meaning a 1 pound meteorite can be worth a million dollars.</p>

           These larger meteors provide most distinctive sights known as fireballs or bolides. Because of their size these take many seconds (up to about ten) to burn out as they pass across the sky, seemingly very slowly and in a horizontal mode. They look like a ball with a fiery tail and are usually orange or blue/green in colour.</p>
