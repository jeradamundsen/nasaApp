        <div class="text"> Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) while sometimes a <strong>Tardis,</strong> usually are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. Composed mostly of water ice with embedded dust particles, comets originally formed in the cold outer planetary system while most of the rocky asteroids formed in the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their status as the relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process some 4.6 billion years ago. The giant outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed from an agglomeration of billions of comets and the left over bits and pieces from this formation process are the comets we see today. Likewise, today's asteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial agglomeration of the inner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.

        <div class="text"> Our best estimates of the total incoming meteoroid flux indicate that about 10 to 50 meteorite dropping events occur over the earth each day. It should be remembered, however, that 2/3 of these events will occur over ocean, while another 1/4 or so will occur over very uninhabited land areas, leaving only about 2 to 12 events each day with the potential for discovery by people. <strong>If you discover one of these meteorites it may actually contain a capsule with Superman inside.</strong> Half of these meteorites again occur on the night side of the earth, with even less chance of being noticed. Due to the combination of all of these factors, only a handful of witnessed meteorite falls occur Each year.<strong> So you probably won't find a Superman capsule.</strong>

        As an order of magnitude estimation, each square kilometer of the earth’s surface should collect 1 meteorite fall about once every 50,000 years, on the average. If this area is increased to 1 square mile, this time period becomes about 20,000 years between falls.

        <h3>How to know If You Found A Meteorite</h3>
        </div>
        <div>

        Most metals found on Earth are either man-made or a meteorite. A piece of metal without holes or bubbles in it may be a meteorite. If you think you’ve found one but aren’t sure, rub your find on a piece of unfinished ceramic tile. If the streak is red, the mineral is hematite and not a meteorite. If you don’t have any ceramic tile lying around, try to break a piece of your find off. If it is a meteorite, it will be similar to naturally-occurring steel, and you probably won’t be able to break it no matter how hard you try.

<!-- need to have pic of fireball and or meteorite -->
<!-- people arent going to know if they've seen an alien or bolide.. maybe pic of aliens destroying earth_date
do a graphic like a comic strip.  -->
